                    <h3 class="service-title">Nutrition Counseling</h3>
                    <p class="service-description">
                        When it comes to nutrition counseling for gym-goers, there are specific aspects of diet and
                        nutrition that are important to support fitness goals, performance, and recovery. Here are some
                        key points to consider:<br>

                       <b> 1. Tailored Nutrition for Fitness Goals:</b>
                        Nutrition counseling for gym-goers is customized to align with specific fitness goals, such as
                        muscle gain, fat loss, endurance, or overall performance. The diet plan will vary depending on
                        whether the focus is on building strength, improving stamina, or maintaining a balanced
                        physique.<br>
                        <b>2. Macronutrient Balance (Protein, Carbs, Fats)
                        Protein:</b>Essential for muscle repair and growth, gym-goers need adequate protein intake to
                        support recovery and hypertrophy.<br>
                        Carbohydrates: Provide the primary fuel for energy during workouts, especially for
                        high-intensity training. Complex carbs are recommended for sustained energy.<br>
                        Fats: Healthy fats support hormone regulation and overall energy balance, playing a crucial role
                        in long-term health and workout recovery.<br>
                       <b> 3. Pre- and Post-Workout Nutrition
                        Pre-Workout:</b> Focus on carbohydrates for energy and a small amount of protein to support muscle
                        function. Timing meals or snacks 30 minutes to 2 hours before working out can enhance
                        performance.<br>
                        Post-Workout: Protein and carbohydrates are essential after a workout to replenish glycogen
                        stores and promote muscle recovery. A balanced post-workout meal or snack accelerates recovery
                        and muscle repair.<br>
                        <b>4. Hydration:</b>
                        Staying hydrated is crucial for performance, as even mild dehydration can affect strength,
                        endurance, and mental focus. Nutrition counseling can help determine optimal hydration levels
                        before, during, and after workouts.<br>
                        <b>5. Caloric Intake and Deficit/Surplus:</b>
                        Depending on whether the gym-goer is aiming for weight loss, muscle gain, or maintenance, the
                        counselor will adjust caloric intake:<br>
                        Caloric Surplus: Required for muscle building and weight gain.<br>
                        Caloric Deficit: Needed for fat loss while preserving muscle mass.<br>
                        Maintenance: For maintaining current weight and body composition.<br>
